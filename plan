SO il use cloudeflare to store the webp
then il use convex as the chat database?
that makes sense 

First il just host a simple mnaga maybe like
Part 7 Jojo yeah that good reads tbh


Ok so now i should make it so that
Python script to automate the pushing to the bucket and convex 
but 
I should also create a "dev envirorment" so that i dont have to have multipe terminal windows open just to run the app/db

the script still sucks i probably need to do it myself breh



ok so i can put it onto cloudelflaer pages
but o

ok its kinda working now but i should first make it so it can upload complete mangas first
then make it so i can automaticlaly update the bucket from the backend with digital ocean functions
:


** if you skip to lets say page 50 it loads everything up to that point your skipping so theirs no point dude
**i should upload a full manga "which one"
what if site to keep track of stuff?
